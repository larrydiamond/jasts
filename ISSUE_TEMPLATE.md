Hi.   Adding requests or submitting bug reports is easy to do and we're chill.   At least my daughter sounds like that, I'm flex.   

In any case, if there's some feature that you would like to see added to the framework, please feel free to create an issue to let us know.

If you are submitting a bug report, please provide sample code so that we can reproduce the issue.   At the time I type this, I know of no defects in the framework, but that never means that there are no defects.   It's okay, please provide sample code so we can reproduce and we thank you for letting us know of any defects.
