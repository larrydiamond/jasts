Please contribute!   

If you've got something you'd love to share, please feel free to submit a pull request with your change.    Also feel free to post questions and/or email me at ldiamond at ldiamond dot com.

I'd really appreciate if you'd take a look at the open issues I've created and picked one and did it.

All contributors will be listed in the README.md page and thoroughly and properly thanked.   Open Source would not exist without wonderful people like you and I appreciate your time and effort!
